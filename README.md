# Module-2-Assignments
This is the Module 2 Assignment Where I will be creating a program that will anazyle stock data on a quarterly basis. The Goal of this program is to show each stock along with its corresponding information. 

This information includes:
                Quarterly change:
                          The first value 'close' of the quarter minus the previous quarter
                          
                Quarterly Percent change:
                          Quarterly change value * 100
                  
                Total stock volume:
                          The total amount of stocks traded for each quarter


All documents are included showing the code and the successful outcomes
